Sequential Search
----------------------------------------
The algorithm can be used on any list structure. 
It'll iterate one-by-one through the array and see
if the target matches each element. As a result the 
algorithm has a linear relationship with the array size.

S(n) = n;

On average half of the list will be gone through 
before the target is found.
