Bubble Sort Algorithm
-----------------------------------------------
It starts at the beginning of the list. It'll 
then check if the element to the left of it is
greater than the current element that it's on
if so then it'll swap those element. As a result
you're left with a sorted array. The growth of the 
algorithm with size (n) is parabolic. 

B(n) = n^2
